# Assignment-1

Implementation of word2vec skip-gram model using tensorflow and evaluate the final model using SimLex-999 and word-analogy.

## Train New Model
Run word2vec.py for training a new model from scratch. You can change the different hyperparameter by modifying the values in source code.

## Model Evaluation using SimLex-999
Run evaluate.py for evaluating the trained final model. It will give the spearman rank correlation for the cosine similarity between embedding of a pair of words generated by model and the value given by SimiLex-999 dataset.
